                       I approached  Nixace Technologies sir after my failed attempts at conceptual learning for SFM topics. Not only did sir help me with my concepts but also helped me find a new found intrest in financial management above and beyond my Ca course. I Scored an exemption in SFM all because of Manish Sir. One thing I liked was his not rushing with the topics at all unlike other teachers. He explained the concepts with his real life examples making it easier to retain. I would recommend him to everybody having trouble with the the conceptual or technical aspect of the subject. To sum it up it up I personally found the experience informative and learning.

                     Manish sir has done an excellent job in teaching me SFM for my CA final. Sir has explained the subject as a whole as well has done a detailed study of each topic. Sir's method of teaching and techniques have helped me understand the theoritical as well as the practical aspect of the subject which enabled me to solve the questions in exam with a broad mind. Conceptual learning has been the motto and concepts that we learned are still remembered, even after the exams

                    No other Professor can teach SFM better in concepts  than Manish  Sir .It was his simplistic & easily understandable teaching  which made me get an exemption in SFM and to get me through group 1 in CA Final.  Couldnt have wished for better professor and mentor than you, Manish Sir .

                    "Excellent conceptual teaching, even the difficult areas are explained in a simplified way. Best thing is students are even able to handle difficult sums if asked in exams as concepts are clear. No other books should be referred other than the notes provided as it covers everything "

                    "Sir, it was a great experience studying from you...!! The best part of Prof Nixace Technologies is linking of chapters with examples of practical world. SFM was never my favourite subject but studing with you did wonders for me and now I know how to apply these techniques I learned at the institute, you made study interesting by bringing clarity in concepts with simple ways of learning. Studying the chapters like Portfolio, Forex, Derivatives, seemed like climbing a mountain to me but now I am very much cofident with concepts and able to manage these chapters in an affirmative way. I would like to this opportunity and refer as many students as possible to Prof Nixace Technologies for his simple ways of teaching, easy to learn concepts and finally sharing his overwhelming experience and knowledge of all the years of teaching with us."
