                            <p>I began my career as Senior Software Engineer with India's largest IT Company "Infosys Technologies Limited" and successfully completed 2years.</p>
                            <p>I have contributed over 4 years in Finance industry while working with Morgan Stanley as an Equity Research Associate. I applied my Financial skills from MBA and CFA during my professional career at Morgan Stanley.</p>
                            <p>I am currently handling the marketing and financial department of my family business "Ashok Engineering Works", supplier of spare parts across the cement industry.</p>
                            <p>Being well averse with day to day finaincial implications that a small and medium enteprise faces, and with my corporate exposure at Morrgan Stanley, I am in a better position to explain the concepts of SFM in detail and in the most practical and simplified way.</p>

                             <p>I discovered my passion for teaching during my MBA program at Syracuse University, New York, USA. I got a chance to experience a very different approach to learning when in USA. I realised that conceptual learning which is linked to the practical world is the best way to learn things.</p>
                                <p>My determination of teaching further strengthened when I interviewed and met many CA candidates while at Morgan Stanley. I found that most of them who had very strong credentials and academic records lacked in basic conceptual understanding of the subject.</p>
                                <p>I will help you to learn, understand and implement the concepts not only to master the exams, but also prepare yourself to implement the same in practical world. I believe that anything learnt in the correct manner can definately get success.</p>
