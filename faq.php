		<div class="faq">
			<h3>3. Are all institute problems included in your notes? Are your notes sufficient for preparing for SFM ?</h3>
			<p>Yes. We have taken special care to ensure that not even a single problem is left out from institute notes.

		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<h3>4. Do you solve the problems on board during live lectures?</h3>
			<p>Yes we do solve some problems on board to give a demonstration on how to proceed. However I first

		<div class="faq">
			<h3>5. What if I miss a session? Do I have an option to attend the lecture later?</h3>
			<p>Yes you can attend the lecture later when a new batch starts, If you are not appearing for immediate

			attempt. If you are appearing for immediate attempt it is very difficult to accommodate such requests

			and we highly recommend students to not miss any lecture. We are here to provide as much support as

			we can however there are certain limitations for immediate attempt students.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<h3>6. When should I ideally join the classes for SFM?</h3>
			<p>This answer is very simple. “The sooner the better”. However we generally recommend students to join

			a year in advance before the exam as that gives enough time for preparation as well as revision.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<h3>7. Will I be allowed to re-attend the lectures in case I do not clear my attempt?</h3>
			<p>We want and we expect every one to clear the exam at first attempt, as we believe in our coaching

			methodology and fundamentals. We always put in 100% effort and expect our students to put efforts in

			excess of that. Yes you are allowed to reattend subject to availability of seats in the class.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq">
			<h3>8. Do you advise taking CFA exam if I am good at SFM?</h3>
			<p>Anyone who is good at SFM and is inclined to enter into Financial Services industry, I would recommend

			them taking up CFA exam, as it supplements your knowledge and is a great value addition from global

			perspective.</p>
